# CHEM225-Project

### 4/11/19 



#### Phase 1 | Write a program that prints the alpha and beta string determinants for singles substitutions.

##### Additional Items to Code

- [ ] Add code to read nAlpha, nBeta, and nBasis directly from command line. (Not Done)
- [ ] Find a way to format the output so that the alpha and beta strings are demarcated by a space. This should work for any nBasis. (Not Done)
- [ ] Fix the conditional statement that requires nBasis to be greater than either nAlpha or nBeta. (Not Done)

#### Phase 2 | Modify the program so that it uses the array containing nDet # of singles substitutions as the reference for the doubles substitutions. 

##### Additional Items to Code

- [ ] Create another subroutine for doubles. Find a way to pass the complete singles array into the doubles subroutine so that it reads it as IDet = 1.

#### Phase 3 | Form Integrals Based on SC Rules

- [ ] XOR : Check for differences in orbital occupations.
